This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in TypeScript related to optional properties. The `printCoord` function expects an object with `x` and `y` properties. However, if you call the function with an object missing either property, you will encounter a runtime error. The solution illustrates how to handle optional properties gracefully using optional chaining or type guards.
